**usage of Purestake's evm-precompile-utils package**

The evm-precompile-utils package and it's macro resides in this repo is copied from moonbeam's own fork repo of project frontier, since moonbeam will eventually upstream those changes to the frontier project we rely on, we'll use a customized fork for and only for pinning the package for our version dependency. All credit goes to the original creator of purestake team.
